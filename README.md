## 🐍 info

Me + Colin made a snake game based on Google's snake game.  
“Most visual assets were borrowed from other games for learning purposes. I do not claim ownership over them.” 
But I did get the audio from Colin so I didn’t steal that.

- Uses **SFML** as the multimedia library  
- Made in **Visual Studio**

## 💭 Notes

I am aware that the snake movement could have been better.  
I decided to move the snake with velocities rather than basing it on tiles — I don't think it was a good decision.  
Also, due to a lack of Classes and lots of hard-coded stuff, the code is not very readable.  
I might improve upon these blemishes later.
